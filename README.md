This isn't really a readme, it's just information for myself  

- this is basically a API party  
- if not for herokus free tier's limits I will throw a lot more libraries at this, but I guess that can left to a local project 
- quite a lot of this is based on duckduckgo's instant answer API, and in meantime I'm trying to figure out how to parse wikipedia's infobox without using an external library  
- currently I'm working on getting the NLP to identify different kinds of queries, will probably throw some kind of classifer in front of it
